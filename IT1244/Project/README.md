## Getting Started

### Dependencies
Below are the versions of libraries that were used. Different versions may still work.
* python          3.9.13
* matplotlib      3.5.2
* numpy           1.21.6
* pandas          1.4.2
* sklearn         1.0.2
* tensorflow      2.9.2

### Setup
Ensure [clients dataset](https://github.com/austinloh/NUS/blob/main/IT1244/Project/client.csv) and [invoices datset](https://github.com/austinloh/NUS/blob/main/IT1244/Project/invoice.csv) are located in the same directory as the [main code file](https://github.com/austinloh/NUS/blob/main/IT1244/Project/IT1244_Project.ipynb)

### Running the Project
* Open the [main code file](https://github.com/austinloh/NUS/blob/main/IT1244/Project/IT1244_Project.ipynb) either in jupyter notebook (to run locally) or upload to google colab (to run on cloud). 
* Running locally is recommended as it is much faster
* Run each cell block in the notebook sequentially
